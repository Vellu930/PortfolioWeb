        <p>I’m gon’ put her in a coma. You give a hundred reasons why, and you say you're really gonna try. So I sat
          quietly, agreed politely. Suiting up for my crowning battle. And on my 18th Birthday we got matching
          tattoos. So très chic, yeah, she's a classic. I am ready for the road less traveled.</p>
        <p>I'm walking on air (tonight). But down to earth. You're original, cannot be replaced. But in another life I
          would be your girl. We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach. We can dance, until we die, you and I, will
          be young forever. Saw you downtown singing the Blues.</p>
